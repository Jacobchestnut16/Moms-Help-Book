<div class="_c5e6775b6d0e _1cf01590ca60"><p style="margin-left:18pt;">A1.</p>
    <p style="margin-left:18pt;">Modern medicine started to evolve in the 18th century, after the industrial revolution.
        At this time, rapid growth was seen in the economic activities in the Americas and Western Europe. In the 19th
        century, this industrial and economic growth start increasing even more and helped people to make several
        scientific inventions and discoveries like microscopes. Scientists made huge progress in the identification and
        prevention of illness and understood how viruses and bacteria work. On the basis of that, eventually, the cures
        and treatment of infectious diseases were formed.&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-left:18pt;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-left:18pt;">After the 19th century, different incidents start occurring that led to the development
        of medicines. They are:</p>
    <p style="margin-left:18pt;">a. Industry: After the industrial revolution, the formation of more industries
        increased along with more work-related diseases. They included dermatitis, phossy jaw, and lung disease that
        required the development of new medicines.&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-left:18pt;">b. Urban sprawl: New medicines were required as cities began expanding rapidly and
        brought several diseases like typhus and cholera.&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-left:18pt;">c. Travel: As people traveled from one place to another, they started developing
        diseases like yellow fever. It also demanded new medicines.&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-left:18pt;">Different historical events lead to the development of new medicines as well. They are:&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-left:18pt;">a. Scientific breakthroughs: After the development of the ‘germ theory, the principles
        of antisepsis and hygiene were started to be tested and proved for preventing infections and treating wounds.
        Electrocardiograph was discovered at this time and on the basis of the heart’s condition, new medicines were
        formulated.&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-left:18pt;">b. Communication: The improvement of communication improved the accumulation of medical
        knowledge for making medicines.&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-left:18pt;">c. Political changes: Democracy asked people to demand health as a human right and
        influenced medicine formation.&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-left:18pt;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-left:18pt;">Also, Florence Nightingale, a British nurse, writer, and statistician of the 19th
        century discovered the reason for mass infection on the battlefield to be poor hygiene standards and a lack of
        medication. They influenced the nurses on the battlefield to maintain sanitation and hygiene and proper hospital
        planning and help to save a lot of people. The field of preventive medicine was developed by Florence
        Nightingale.&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-left:18pt;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-left:18pt;">Also, the formation of several technologies is helping patients in knowing about their
        health conditions and medicines through Telehealth and Telemedicine. The tendency of consulting healthcare
        professionals and learning about medicines from one’s own house before going to a hospital setting has increased
        more after the communicable coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. Technologies are also helping to maintain the
        record of the medicines of the patient in a secure way through electronic health records and
        barcoding.&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-left:18pt;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-left:18pt;"><strong>Your question is too long, so unfortunately we cannot answer it all with one
        single answer. So, here's just the first part (question A1), please submit the next parts as separate questions
        so I can better explain each of them.</strong></p>
