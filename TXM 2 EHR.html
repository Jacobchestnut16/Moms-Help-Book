The method of use at this moment has many issues with the transferring and reciprocation step.
The Billing, Coding, and Financial Service Department is working from a centralized downtown
office and the hospital staff are currently using a courier to take the needed records to the
downtown office in order to allow the process to flow. Any delays in the receiving of the records
affects the administrative process. The incorrect departments are receiving the records before
they should and delaying the process even more. (Amatayakul, M. ,2016)</p><p>In addition, HIM staff is facing issues with keeping up with any Release of Information
  requests. The ROI requests coming from patients, auditors, and attorneys are imperative to be
  done as soon as possible once it’s received. Due to the records being in different locations, some
  of these requests have to be on hold because of unavailability.</p><p><strong>A2:</strong> According to the scenario, some of the senior nurses prefer paper documents and
  traditional modes as it is what they are accustomed to. Resistance to change is a common
  concern when switching to a different system. The staff will be comfortable in what they know
  and having to learn a new process along with a new electronic system can be very taxing.
  Especially with their regular duties that they are still responsible for during the transition. In the
  scenario, it states that Dr. Morgan is concerned whether the switch to electronic records would
  benefit the physicians and although he is open to learning a new process, he still has some
  apprehension to leaving the paper process behind. The new nursing staff, however, already have
  experience in using EHR, and are more open to using it. The Health Information Management</p><p>staff may also worry that there will be even more delays while the system is being updated to
  electronic. In cases like these, it’s helpful to have someone that is already experienced in the
  system, who will be able to assist the staff in learning and is available live to assist with any
  issues that may come up.</p><p><strong>A3:</strong> The staff will need to have the ability to access and share patient information
  securely as per request for Release of Information. The HIM staff must be able to verify the
  patient’s patient consent and release data to the required entity following HIPAA protocols.
  (Electronic Health Record., n.). They will also need to have the capacity to access the PHI and
  current patients plans and retrieve records according to specific criteria (Electronic Health
  Record., n.). Implementing an EHR will allow the HIM staff to work on their administrative
  processes without any much delay and will allow the process to be streamlined.</p><p><strong>A4:</strong> HIPAA is a federal law that enforces national standards for protecting sensitive
  patient health information from being like their medical records from being disclosed without the
  patient's consent and knowledge (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
  (HIPAA)., n.). HIPAA Privacy Rules require companies to safeguard the details of patient
  records. The advanced security measures that come in EHR can provide extra security than using
  paper records. EHRs come with a standard amount of security protections such as audit trail to
  follow up with any actions done in the system with the patient’s information. This is done by
  automatically recording who has accessed the patient’s information and keeping track of what is
  done with the information from the system. This allows the users to audit the processes and can
  allow for easier notification of any breaches that could happen. Data encryptions is another</p><p>compensation, payment for services rendered by any contractors, and the infrastructure necessary
  to complete the project. Capacity planning is essential to make sure the project is completed on
  time and the objective is accomplished per the expectations. Resources, major milestones, and
  the start and end dates of a project are agreed upon before the onset of the project. They are
  essential, especially if the institution uses government reimbursement programs like Medicare
  and Medicaid, as the incentives are dependent on the completion the EHR. Keeping track of
  dependencies helps track project progress and plan for risk mitigation earlier during execution of
  the project. Identifying any risks early on, whether while planning or early execution, will allow
  you to take corrective action. Constraints to the project can include federal regulations, company
  policy, or resource availability. These should be identified early just like risks. A contingency
  plan for any risks needs to be planned and set in motion when they are encountered. Status
  checks of the project can help with project control and being able to monitor the progress of the
  project. These can be weekly updates by the different parties working on the project and being
  able to act to help with any roadblocks. Documenting any project issues and lessons learned
  should be part of closing the project. This also includes working with any vendors to determine
  final costs, detecting any cost overruns or surpluses, and checking to ensure the requirements of
  the project were met.</p><p><strong>B2.</strong> A project team is essential to the process. This begins with identifying what skillsets
  are necessary to accomplish the project. The team normally consists of a Project Manager,
  multiple Team Leads, and team members knowledgeable in the project. The project manager
  ensures the progress of the project and keeps any sponsors, stakeholders, and owners informed.</p><p>Part of the team needs to include an educator or trainer to follow up with any staff that will be
  using the project after it has been completed.</p><p><strong>B3:</strong> EHR adoption allows the organization faster access to the patient information and
  provides the patient with the required treatment as soon as possible. It also allows for better
  coordination of quality care between any providers that may be involved. The reduced reaction
  time on any critical decisions for care will really help the organization provide the best care for
  their patients.</p><p><strong>C1:</strong> Before starting a project, the organization should perform a cost-benefit analysis on
  the project. This consists of getting quotes for completing the project from various vendors and
  the costs to the company during and post-implementation of the EHR adaptation. Determining
  the return of investment in the adaptation should be key in undertaking an EHR project. "The
  cost related to EHR implementation may be categorized into two groups: system costs and
  induced costs" (Wang &amp; Biedermann, n.). Being able to know how much it will cost, and what
  you be getting out of the project in the long run is very advantageous. Having quotes from
  several vendors allows you to see which one matches your expectations and what parts of the
  EHR are the more important ones for you.</p><p><strong>C2.</strong> A request for information (RFI) is a request to receive information from any potential
  vendors about a project. The organization can then shortlist any vendors that satisfy their
  requirements. A request for proposal (RFP) is a request from the shortlisted vendors to provide a
  proposal for the project to understand their costs and what they are offering. An RFI would be</p><p>will involve. The Anticipated Selection Schedule provide the timelines that the vendor will be
  using if selected. The time and place of Submission of the Proposals describes the place, and
  deadlines for submitting the project proposal. The timeline of the project should be included to
  show how long it will take for the project to be completed. The Elements of Proposal also need
  to include a checklist of any must-haves and should-haves that the potential vendor can deliver.
  The Evaluation Criteria is a list of requirements the vendor must have to make the cut for the
  project. Ant possible Roadblocks or constraints that the vendor should know before submitting a
  Response should be part of the proposal. (VanBlaricon, 2022), Lastly, the budget for the
  project should be included, It’s the money that a vendor may receive after satisfactorily
  completing the project. (Forsey, 2022).</p><p><strong>C4:</strong> Establishing a good working relationship with vendors is crucial to accomplishing
  the project requirements. It includes having open communication and being respectful of the time
  of all parties involved. This helps build trust with all stakeholders and shares progress and risks
  during project execution. By staying in contact with one another, all parties are able to be up to
  date in what they may be needing and what roadblocks they may be encountering. By being
  adaptable to those issues, it will keep a good rapport.</p><p><strong>References</strong></p><p><em>Electronic health records: EHR Essentials</em>. Research Guides. (2020, October 13). Retrieved May
