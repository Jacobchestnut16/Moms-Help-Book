  <li><p>Describe <strong>one</strong> area needing assessment in the organization’s health information management
    (HIM) workflow.
    One area needing assessment in the organization's health information management workflow is
    the ROI and coding team. Currently, the charts are being transferred across town and to other
    facilities. They are sitting stacked in chairs waiting for review. Lastly, there is miscommunication
    between the processing and coding teams.</p></li>
  <li><p>Explain one concern related to adopting an EHR that staff from the area needing assessment in
    part A1 may have.
    One concern that staff may have related to adopting an EHR is that the staff may feel that
    learning a new workflow will slow down the current workflow. The staff may feel overwhelmed
    by too many changes in a system. Some may feel like they do not have enough time for training,
    and it will back up their staff's current flow. Change stresses staff out, so it is essential to have an
    implementation plan.</p></li>
  <li><p>Explain the functional needs that staff members in the HIM department may have.
    Functional needs that staff members in the HIM department may have are related to what was
    previously mentioned; The charts transferred across facilities have a high chance of getting
    misplaced or stolen. The charts sitting stacked in chairs may affect patients’ privacy. A system
    can be created by adding alerts that the HIM staff can communicate with ROI by having a
    centralized location for healthcare records. The HIM department will be able to protect patient
    information and data securely when the HER is implemented with the reduction of lost files.</p></li>
  <li><p>Description of project approach- The institution should know what kind of culture the
    vendor has and what the institution prefers. Do you want the vendor to come to the
    organization and take over the project managing, or do you want the organization to have
    a more staged approach? These are ideas that need to be laid out during the agreement
    and planning.</p></li>
  <li><p>Breakdown structure- It is vital to have a work breakdown structure; this includes
    specific tasks within the project, which are then spread into different phases. There may
    be many project goals in an EHR complex project. Project planning software such as
    Gantt charts helps manage the projects and stay on time.</p></li>
  <li><p>Budget management- Many institutions and vendors track their hours billed differently,
    so it is essential to understand the contractual agreement related to billing. Some vendors
    will bill depending on time spent or projects accomplished. In general, one should be
    more concerned with sticking to the overall budget and sticking to it.</p></li>
  <li><p>Capacity plan and start dates- start and target dates are important because one may
    depend on the other for completion. One project may not start until the previous step is
    completed. Having start dates and end dates is also essential, primarily if the institution
    depends on government reimbursement programs and needs the EHR to be completed to
    receive those incentives.</p></li>
  <li><p>Miles stones, target end dates, and dependencies- Gantt charts, spreadsheet, flow chart, or
    simple list can help track milestones and target end dates. Assigning key players with
    target end dates may help complete any deliverables to ensure no delays. (Udoagwu,</p><ol start="2020">

  <li><p>Risks, constraints, and assumptions - Identifying risks early and planning how to manage
    them is crucial. "constraints, assumptions, and contingencies of each risk should be
    identified." (Amatayakul, 2017)</p></li>
  <li><p>Supporting detail- A GANTT chart shows the amount of work done or production
    completed in specific periods in relation to the amount planned for those periods. These
    are very popular in project planning to help the team stay on task.

    Assembling a project team needs many players:</p></li>
  <li><p>We must identify staff interested in the project and outcomes of the project to make the
    clinical champion.</p></li>
  <li><p>We must identify a project manager and its team members who will assist with the
    representation of hospital/clinical staff.</p></li>
  <li><p>We will need the EHR implementation team to design and test the changes and additions
    made in the new EHR.
    One benefit the healthcare organization can gain from adopting an EHR is providing better
    healthcare. By adopting an EHR, the organization has faster access to accessing lab results and
    treating the problem as soon as possible. Smaller health clinics may also have nurses imputing
    vital signs while the doctor reviews them in a different room before seeing a patient for faster,
    accurate care. ( <em>What are the advantages of Electronic Health Records?</em> 2019)</p></li>
  <li><p>Justify how a cost-benefit analysis will help focus the vendor selection process.
    "A cost-benefit analysis is an estimate of costs and benefits conducted before vendor selection"
    (Amatayakul, 2017). A cost-benefit analysis is needed to determine the budget for the given</p></li>
  <li><p>Explain the elements included in writing a request for proposal and the information included
    in each element.
    The elements in an RFP are listed below:</p><ol>
    <li>The organizational profile shows the enterprise mission statement and projects it has
      completed. It provides the vendor overview of the entire organization.</li>
    <li>Vendor Information- the information should be under the profile, including information
      about the vendor's size, longevity in business, references, and contract history.</li>
    <li>Functional specifications- The organization requests a description of functional
      capability.</li>
    <li>Operational and Technical Requirements- These sections would propose a technical
      architecture to meet the organization's specific requirements.</li>
    <li>Application support - The vendor uses this section to propose an implementation
      schedule and describe conversions, training, documentation, and support to supply
      upgrades.</li>
    <li>Licensing and contractual details- this section would include the stipulations.</li>
    <li>Evaluation criteria- this section would include how the organization weighs various
      factors.
      To establish a good working relationship with vendors and company representatives, you first
      need open communication, conversations that promote dialogue, and a plan to effectively use the
      time when meeting. It is crucial to bring an outline to meetings with vendors or company
      representatives, so everyone can be honest and express their needs and wants for the enterprises
      or doctors' offices. When communicating, you want to be honest and respectful of every
      stakeholder's time for planning and executing the project. Communication helps build trust</li>

<p>within each other. Lastly, frequently meeting online or in-person helps share current progress and
  ask questions about the project.</p><p>Citations</p><p>Amatayakul, M. (2017). Health IT and EHRs: Principles and Practice (6th
